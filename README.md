---   NAS 2024 Project Overview   ---

The aim of this project was to develop a custom built Network Attached Storage (NAS) both for personal experience and use. To further our own understanding of the subject area and associated technologies, we opted not to use a "plug and play" system. Instead, we will make decisions about what hardware will be utilized, which operating systems, implement a file system, and make any necessary modifications to system configuration to create a more secure environment.

Some goals we would like to meet on this project include:
* Utilizing AndroidOS for the operating system, as it provides an open-source, lightweight platform that uses minimal power consumption.
* Implement a file system of our own choosing.
* Strike a team-defined balance between secure implementation and ease of use.

All of the resources used for this project can be found on this GitHub page.
